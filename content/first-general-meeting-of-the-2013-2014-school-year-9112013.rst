There will be a general meeting Wednesday, September 11 at 4:30pm in
Science 164.  We will be planning upcoming events including
Info-sessions, guest speakers, workshops, social events and career
preparatory activities. If you have a great idea for the club this is
the meeting to share it with everyone.

 

See you all there!
