Raspberry Pi & Arduino Meetup in Oakland - Wed 3/5 @ 7pm

[Ace Monster Toys](http://acemonstertoys.org/) (AMT) holds Raspberry Pi & Arduino Nights every other Wednesday. Open to the public, come work on micro controllers, Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, whatever you want. Resident "expert" David R. will be on hand to help you get started, provide parts to build your own cheap arduino clone, give advice on your current project, or give ideas.

The ACM @ SFSU can help arrange carpools for interested parties.

We are also holding a [Raspberry Pi Workshop](raspberry-pi-workshop.html) Fri 3/7 @3pm, in TH 329. Come to both events to kickstart a neat project!
