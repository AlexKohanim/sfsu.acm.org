Hello everyone!

 

The first general meeting will be held tomorrow in the CS Undergrad Lab
(SCI 254) at 3pm.  This will be a short meeting discussing the upcoming
events for the spring semester.  If you can't make it we will post up
the things we discussed on the main site.   Hope to see you there.
