Our next event will be a student-led study session utilizing the Udacity
course "Intro to Computer Science"
(`https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101`_) taught by Professor Dave
Evans. This event will provide students an introduction to the Python
programming language while learning about the components of a modern
search engine. Please enroll in this FREE online course and review the
material before attending Friday's event. This is a Beginner-level
course so if you've never programmed before or if you just want to learn
a new language with a group of your fellow CS students, this event is
for you. This event is going to be held on Friday 2/14 (Valentine's
Day).
