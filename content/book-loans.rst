San Francisco State ACM has its own library full of donated books from
previous semesters. Need a textbook? We have textbooks for computer
science, math, and physics courses. We let you borrow books for a
semester instead of purchasing one at your expense. This FREE service is
for members only. Not a member? No problem -- it's cheaper to `join our
ACM chapter`_ than to buy a single textbook.

**How to check out a book:**

#. Check the book list below, or posted on the back cabinet of the
   Undergraduate Computer Science Lab. This list shows every book we
   have.
#. Find the book you would like to borrow from this list.
#. E-mail the ACM at SFSU (acm.sfsu@gmail.com) to arrange a check out
   session.
#. Come to check out session.
#. Read and Sign `Library Lending Agreement`_.
#. Take book home and put it to good use.

**How to donate a book:**

We need your used textbooks! We are currently accepting textbooks for
computer science, math, engineering, and physics courses. To donate a
textbook, you can email the ACM at SFSU (acm.sfsu@gmail.com) or drop
your book off in the CS dept. office (TH-906.)
