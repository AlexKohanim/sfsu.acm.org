Summary: Calling for Raspberry Pi projects! We're having a Raspberry Pi workshop on Friday, March 7th. The CS department has given us several RPi's, and we want to use them for your projects!

Raspberry Pi workshop - Fri 3/7 @3pm, TH 329

The [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org) is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video. 

The CS department at SFSU has purchased several Raspberry Pis for the ACM to distribute amongst the students to create independent programming & electronics projects. There is a large online community for these devices. Examples of projects others have done using Raspberry Pis include:

* [Light painting](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1749)
* [T-shirt Cannon](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5867)
* [Media Server](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/4621)
* [Scientific Research](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/3798)
* [HD Surveillance Camera](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5071)
* [Google Glass Live Translation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1689)
* [Pure Data](http://puredata.info) on the rPi. See [Satellite CCRMA on the Pi](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/wiki/Satellite_CCRMA_First_Steps) and [Miller Puckette with the Pi](http://vimeo.com/52265243).

If you have a great project idea or just want to learn more about DIY electronics please attend this event!

We're also meeting at Ace Monster Toys in Oakland on Wednesday, March 5th at 7pm, for their weekly [Raspberry Pi meetup](raspberry-pi-arduino-meetup-in-oakland.html). Come to learn and get project ideas!
