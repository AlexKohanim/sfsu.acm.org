The ACM is offering open tutoring for Computer Science courses taken at SFSU.

Friday tutoring sessions will immediately follow the weekly ACM meetings and will be held in the same room. Tutors will also reserve study rooms in the Leonard Library a few days in advance of the tutoring sessions listed below. 

*Check this calendar regularly for changes to meeting times and locations.*

***Please email [acm.sfsu@gmail.com](mailto: acm.sfsu@gmail.com)*** *24 hours in advance* if you plan on attending a tutoring session. Tutors reserve the right to leave if no one shows up in the first 15 minutes.

Feel free to add the calendar below to your Google account by just
clicking the plus-sign in the bottom right corner.
