Hello everyone!

The next ACM General Meeting will be September 28th.  However we will be
meeting at the Letterman Digital Arts Center for the Lucas Arts Picnic. 
This will be a very casual meeting for everyone, there will be snacks
and refreshments.  We want to take this time to get to know some of the
members and officers of the club, and also hear  your inputs for the
club.  We encourage everyone to try to make it to this event.  We will
be meeting there at 3 PM.  If you are planning to take public
transportation here is a link on info on that:

If you plan on attending please email me or Tim Bauer. We are also
providing some rides if anyone needs it, but space is limited so please
include that in the email if you are attending. We will be meeting in
the visitors parking lot on Letterman Drive (the parking lot just off of
Lombard).  There's a sercurity guard at the entrance, just tell him
you're there visiting and he'll let you pass.
