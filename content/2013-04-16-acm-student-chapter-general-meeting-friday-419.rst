Hello everyone!

There will be a general meeting this friday at 3pm in the CS Undergrad
Lab( SCI 254).  We will be discussing whats to come next year for the
club.  This includes panels, guest speakers, and possible
workshops/events.  If you have an input as to what you want to see
coming from the club I encourage you to show up and speak with us.

See everyone there!

Jonathan Lei

PS - If you're interested in an officer position this is the meeting to
show up to.
