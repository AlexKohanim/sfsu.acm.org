Hello everyone,

We'll be hosting our second General Meeting in the **CS Undergraduate
Lab, SCI 254 on Wednesday October 7th 2009**

On it we will discuss our upcoming trip to Mountain View to the Computer
History Museum on Furlough Friday the 23rd and other plans for the near
future.

Also on our agenda is a chance to gain feedback and responses from our
members on what ACM should be focusing on as a goal, or expectations on
future actions.

Please let us know if you would like to attend but Wednesday afternoons
are not particularly good times to host general meetings. The plan is to
host Novembers meeting on Tuesday or Thursday to accommodate those
excluded by scheduling conflicts.

==============================================================

*On the Lunch Menu we have:*

*Chicken Katsu (XL Platter this time), Fried Rice, Vegetarian
Spheghetti, and Potato Salad.*

*Drinks include Soda and Water.*

==============================================================

**ADDENDUM:**

Chapter Vice President Teague Sterling will be hosting a CAT-5 Ethernet
cable making seminar in the **Undergradulate Lab on** **Tuesday the 6th
at 2 PM**, volunteers and all those interested please show up at the
appointed hour, as an added incentive you may create one long cable (up
to 5 yards) for yourselves to take with you, no questions asked.

-Simon J. Lew; CS Lab Assistant, S.F. State ACM Chapter President.
