Summary: It is the first post with our new blog, we're upgrading our infrastructure, and have lots of upcoming events, hooray!

It is the first post with our new blog, we're upgrading our infrastructure, and have lots of upcoming events. Let me give a brief overview of what's up. 

#HAI
It's a new exciting semester! We had a great turnout to the general meeting (thanks [Marc](http://marcsosnick.com)!) And we just had had our first Python workshop utilizing the Udacity course [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101) taught by Professor Dave Evans. 

Be sure to come out to our next workshop Intro to Android Mobile App Development on Friday 2-21. Download the IDE we’ll be using [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and `git` the demo [here](https://github.com/acm-sfsu/androidHelloWorld). Also, please check out Professor Puder’s [Android tutorial](http://pear.sfsu.edu/csc780/tutorial).

See our other upcoming events at [sfsu.acm.org/calendar](/calendar). Events include a [Button Smashing Night](http://www.buttonsmashingnight.com) at [20mission](http://www.20mission.com), an Intelligence Community Virtual Career Fair, a guest speaker from Twitter, an Intro to Open Source, a Raspberry Pi & Arduino Meetup, and more!

#Blog
Now that the shameless plugs are over with, I thought I'd post about what just happened to the site. We just [forked paullik's IRC-Bot](https://github.com/acm-sfsu/IRC-Bot) to sit in our [#acm-sfsu](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=acm-sfsu) IRC channel, and thought we'd keep up with the Python theme. So, we used the static site generator [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com) which is very similar in process to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Btw, we will be doing a lightning presentation on both Jekyll and Pelican [soon](/calendar), if any of you are interested in leveraging these. Come out and learn to blog like a hacker! 

Aside: maybe the shameless plugs aren't quite over with ;)

##Pelican
[Pelican](http://getpelican.com) is a static site generator powered by [Python](http://python.org)! and is very similar in implementation as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Since we're into social coding, I'd like to use this blog post as a mini-tutorial. So, if you are indeed using this as a tutorial, `git` Pelican [here](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) and read over [getting started](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/getting_started.html) and using [Pelican on Github Pages](https://gist.github.com/josefjezek/6053301).

Our old blog was made in Wordpress. We used `pelican-import` to get the old entries. It has two dependencies:

* BeautifulSoup `pip install BeautifulSoup`
* [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) `apt-get pandoc`

See: [pelican-import](docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/importer.html)

Import with `pelican-import --wpfile -o content posts.xml` which takes your Wordpress' exported `posts.xml` file and makes [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) (reST) posts of your content in the `content` folder. You can use both [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and reST for writing your posts. 

Aside: This post is written in Markdown if you were curious.

Aside: If you need BeautifulSoup4, `pip install BeautifulSoup4`.

###Generating the site
Run `pelican`. This will generate your site in the `output` folder by default. It also uses your `pelicanconf.py` file by default. See the [basic usage](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/getting_started.html#basic-usage) for more info such as running `pelican -r` to do automatic reloading when you make changes.

Aside: Alternately, run `make regenerate`.

You can view the site on your browser by opening the `index.html` file in the `output` folder. Also, checkout the [kickstart your blog](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/getting_started.html#kickstart-your-site) section. If you installed [Fabric](http://fabfile.org), you can also run these [useful commands](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/getting_started.html#fabric) for building the site, regenerating, serving, and publishing. Also, you can use `make serve` if you used the quick configuration to generate a `Makefile`.

###Theming
This comes with a default theme, you might need to update the `RELATIVE_URLS` parameter in the `pelicanconf.py` file to utilize your stylesheets etc during development.

If you want to play with the themes, you can quickly switch between themes by cloning some sample ones with `git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes.git themes` and then run pelican with `pelican -t /themes/chunk` or edit `pelicanconf.py` where it says `THEME = "/themes/chunk"` and just run `pelican`. Adding a theme submodule is easy with `git submodule add https://github.com/hdra/pelican-cait.git themes/pelican-cait`. This'll probably save you build issues in the next section.

##Github Pages
To put this on Github Pages, you'll want to use your `output` folder as the `gh-pages` branch, then it can be hosted as a Github Pages page. Follow the [how to use Pelican on Github Pages](https://gist.github.com/josefjezek/6053301) and [Publishing to Github](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/blob/master/docs/tips.rst#publishing-to-github) tutorials.

Most simply:

* `ghp-import output`. By typing `git branch` you'll now see a `gh-pages` branch.
* `git push origin gh-pages`

Aside: or in one command, `make github` which does the same thing.

If you are using an Organization/User page like us, you'll do things slightly different. You'll want *all* of your generated files in the master branch. Do this in the beginning. 

If you didn't do this in the beginning and want to now, keep reading. In this case, you don't have to call your branch `gh-pages`, so we went with `source`. However, originally I was working on all my source in the `master` branch, but then wanted to shift this all over to a `source` branch and then orphan my master and start it from scratch with the generated output.

If you've run across this, follow these instructions ([src](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8762601/how-do-i-rename-my-git-master-branch-to-release/8762728#8762728)):

```
git checkout -b source master     # create and switch to the release branch
git push -u origin source         # push the release branch to the remote and track it
git branch -D master              # delete local master
git push --delete origin master   # delete remote master
```

If trying to delete your master branch with `git branch -D master`, you'll get an error, but you can resolve it by going into your admin settings and changing the default branch to `source`. This is so that Github knows what to serve up when people visit the site. Now you may repeat the command and it will work.

You can verify that `master` was deleted by typing `git branch`. Now we're going to start the master branch from scratch again with `git checkout --orphan master`. Definitely check out the explanations in `git checkout --help` and [creating project pages manually](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually#lets-get-crackin).

That is, we're doing 

* `git checkout --orphan master`. You can confirm that you're in a parentless tree with `git log`.
* and clear out *everything* with `git rm -rf .` and `git clean` the remainder, or manually `rm` anything else . Double-check what you did with `git status`. 

Now move the contents of your `output` folder into the folder, then

* `git add .`
* `git commit -m 'output' -m 'pelican output to master branch'`
* `git push origin master`

See what's up with your beautiful [network](https://github.com/acm-sfsu/acm-sfsu.github.io/network) graph.

Aside: You [get emailed if the build fails](https://github.com/blog/1706-descriptive-error-messages-for-failed-github-pages-builds) when using Jekyll, but not when using Pelican or building otherwise. If you want to confirm, check in your admin settings whether it was built.

Hope to see you at an upcoming [event](/calendar), feel free to stop by in our IRC [#acm-sfsu](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=acm-sfsu) if you have any questions,

Cheers,
Tom
